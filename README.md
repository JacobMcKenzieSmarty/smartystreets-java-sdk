# SmartyStreets Java SDK

The official client libraries for accessing SmartyStreets APIs from Java (and JRE-based languages)

Compatible with Java 11 and later. Earlier Java versions supported by SDK version 3.10.7 and earlier.

You may have noticed this page is curiously sparse. Don't panic, there's [documentation](https://smartystreets.com/docs/sdk/java) and [examples](src/main/java/examples).

When using this library in an Android project, be sure to exclude commons-logging and httpclient as they will conflict with classes provided by Android.
